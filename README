INSTALLATION
================================================================================

For:
	Apple iPhone/iPod Touch 1.0/1.1/1.1.1/1.2/1.3/2.0+
	+ iPod USB cable

You must have:
	libiphone 
	libfuse-dev (and the associated kernel modules)
	libglib2.0-dev
	make
	autoheader
	automake
	autoconf
	gcc

To compile run:
	./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install  # (if you want to install it into your system directories)

On Ubuntu/Debian, you can do:
	sudo apt-get install build-essential automake autoconf \
          libfuse-dev libglib2.0-dev

(make sure that you have compiled libiphone first)


USAGE
================================================================================

Now comes the fun bit!

To mount:

	mount -t ifuse <device file> <mountpoint> (if installed to /sbin)

	./mount.fuse.ifuse <device file> <mountpoint> (for local access)

Note: the device file is not important and can be anything but it will show up
in the mtab, so sometimes it's useful.

To unmount:
	umount <mountpoint>

Currently ifuse (via the AFC protocol) only gives access to the
'/var/root/Media/' chroot on the iPhone (containing music/pictures). However,
if the device has been jailedbreaked a full view of the iPhone's filesystem
will be available with the following command 

	./mount.fuse.ifuse --afc <device file> <mountpoint>

==== Setting up FUSE ====

Note that on some systems, you may have to load the 'fuse' kernel
module first and to ensure that you are a member of the 'fuse' group:

	sudo modprobe fuse
	sudo adduser $USER fuse

You can check your membership of the 'fuse' group with:

	id | grep fuse && echo yes! || echo not yet...

If you have just added yourself, you will need to logout and log back
in for the group change to become visible.
